# HateSpeechInspector
There is so much hate on social media and that's a growing problem which leads to hypertension among people, feeling unacceptability in the society and even suicidals among teenagers. Keeping in viewto eradicate these issues, the first and the foremost step is to identify it. So we've created a web-app named Hate-Speech Inspector.  
An analytical web app that detects Racism, Sexism, Islamophobia, General Hate and NoHate from twitter on run-time and visually analyze it.
The architecture of the app divides into 3 components.
    1.Scraping
